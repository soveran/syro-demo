NAME
      gs -- Gemset management

SYNOPSIS
      gs init
      gs help
      gs [command]

DESCRIPTION
      When called with no arguments, it starts a shell session and
      configures the variables GEM_HOME, GEM_PATH and PATH to point
      to the $PWD/.gs directory. In addition, it sets the GS_NAME
      variable with the name of the current gemset (useful for PS1).

      init
          Creates the $PWD/.gs directory.

      help
          Displays this message.

      [command]
          An optional command that will be executed under gs shell
          session and return to the caller session once finished.
