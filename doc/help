usage: mk [install|check|server|test|console|help]

## Commands

install:
	Initialize your project. It creates the `.gs` directory,
	where the dependencies will be installed, and also the
	`.env` file, where environment variables will be defined.

check:
	Check if all the dependencies are installed.

server:
	Run the application on localhost, port 9393.

test:
	Run tests.

console:
	Start an interactive Ruby session with the application
	available for direct access.

help:
	Display this help text.

## Examples

Initialize the project:

	$ mk install

Make sure Redis is running on port 6379, then run the tests:

	$ mk test

Interact with your application via IRB:

	$ mk console

Once in IRB, you have access to your application. This is an
example of an interactive session:

	>> Web.call("PATH_INFO" => "/", "REQUEST_METHOD" => "GET")
	=> [200, {"Content-Length"=>"201", "Content-Type"=>"text/html"}, ...]

	>> User.all.to_a
	>> []

Finally, you can start the server:

	$ mk server

You can visit `localhost:9393` to access your application. It will
try to send emails using the configuration defined in `.env` under
the `MALONE_URL` environment variable. While testing, you don't
need to worry about the emails sent, but in development it is useful
to see those messages. For that purpose, check
[mt](https://github.com/soveran/mt).
